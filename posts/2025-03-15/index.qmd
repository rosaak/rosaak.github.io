General pattern is `v`, `i` for inner, `a` for around or including white space, `w` for word, `s` for sentence, and p` for paragraph. 

## Select a Word

- `viw` : select inner word (cursor anywhere in word)
- `vaw` : select a word (includes trailing whitespace)
- `*` then `gn` : search for current word, then select it
- after selecting a word with `viw` 
  - use `Shift-U` for upper case

## Select a Sentence

- `vis` : select inner sentence
- `vas` : select around sentence (includes trailing whitespace)

## Select a Paragraph

- `vip`: select inner paragraph
- `vap`: select around paragraph (includes trailing whitespace)

## Select Multiple Paragraphs

- `vip` then `}` : select paragraph, then expand to next paragraph. keep repeating to select more or use '{' for de-selecting.
- TipüíÅ Visual mode (v) then move with j or k to extend selection

## Select Contents Within Braces/Brackets/Quotes etc

- `vi{` : select inner curly braces (text between { and })
- `va{` : select around curly braces (includes the braces)
- `vi[` : select inner square brackets
- `vi(` : select inner parentheses
- `vi"` : select inner double quotes
- `vi'` : select inner single quotes
- `vi<` : select inner angle brackets
- `vi<` : select inner '=', I used for Obsidian highlights 

- TipüíÅ : Replace v with c in any command to change (delete and enter insert mode) instead of just selecting.
